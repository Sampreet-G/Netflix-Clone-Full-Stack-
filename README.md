- Firebase (authentication and Firestore)
- TMDb API for movies and videos
- React Router for navigation
- React Toastify for notifications
- Custom CSS for styling

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone <repository-url>
cd netflix-clone-react


2. **Install dependencies:**
npm install


3. **Firebase Setup:**
- Create a Firebase project.
- Enable Email/Password Authentication.
- Add your Firebase config in `firebase.js`.

4. **Get TMDb API Key:**
- Sign up at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and get an API key.
- The key is used in API fetch headers (already included, but get your own for production).

5. **Start the development server:**
npm run dev


6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components (Navbar, TitleCards, Player, etc.)
